Caveats and Gotchas

Please note: this page explains issues and how to resolve them in FigureShader versions older than 0.6.0. As Blender is getting better and better and new nodes are popping up on the horizon all the time, my focus is to stay in step with what's new and not so much to support old, far-less-capable versions of FigureShader. 


FigureShader 0.5x Behaviour
***************************

After some basic error checking, the script will paint a fairly basic shader on material zones of your figure, including eyelashes and teeth. If you have material zones in the figure that aren't in the list for that figure, those zones are ignored. 

Selecting the wrong base figure will result in no shaders being painted on your figure.

The script will detect some basic issues and display them in a "Please note" dialogue:

This dialogue is a bit temperamental: expect that clicking the 'OK' button will not close the dialogue; moving the cursor away from the dialogue afterwards will.

The script currently traps for:

	1. missing parm\_list.csv - meant to be in the .blend file's folder
	2. missing image\_list.csv - meant to be in the images folder
	3. missing or misspelt image file, referenced in the image\_list.csv file: file name is identified
	4. missing double-quote ( " ) in either the parm\_list.csv or image\_list.csv file
	5. invalid path statements in the parm\_list.csv file

More issues could be managed this way as users identify them.


Invalid Path Issue
******************

For issue # 5, the problem is likely an old path_list.csv version. The old version included two path entries with two keys: img_path and csv_path.


Cross-Platform Support
**********************

This script has currently been tested in Linux (Mint Cinnamon 18.x), on a Macbook Pro running MacOS High Sierra and on Windows 7 Professional. The script loads and runs successfully on all these OSes.


Error Message Management
************************

FigureShader will display known, trapped error messages in a dialogue instead of the Info panel and on the console.   **However, untrapped Python error messages will still show up on the System Console as well as in a temporary popup, and will be Python-esque and seemingly unfriendly.**  I have endeavoured to trap for most errors: however, some will probably still slip through. For that reason, if you expect something to happen and doesn't, the system console is your friend. I tend to run Blender from a Terminal window in Linux (Blenderites know this as the console), so I check there for error messages. In Windows, you can toggle the System Console under: (Menu) Window > Toggle System Console. Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.
